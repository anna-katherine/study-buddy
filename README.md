However, many students may find themselves struggling to efficiently connect with their fellow peers and study together. StudyBuddy is a solution to this problem, providing a simple platform that facilitates study group/study session formation. While it may be similar to existing education softwares like Piazza and Canvas, StudyBuddyâ€™s focus on peer study groups sets it apart, targeting an important need in the education space.
